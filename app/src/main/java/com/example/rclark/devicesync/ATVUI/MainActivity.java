package com.example.rclark.devicesync.ATVUI;

/*
Quick summary of app.
Super irritating to have multiple ATVs that never stay in sync with the apps installed.
This app is intended to communicate with GCE through the google ID to upload apps on the device.
All devices which this app is installed on will do this.
The app will show a list of devices in GCE (information only)
And will show a list of apps which is the superset of all devices
Can then kick off an intent to install each app not installed (or go through a loop to install all)
What also *could* be done is to have a service watching in background and pop up a notification when something installed to another
device.
